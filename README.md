# Thesis Project: Development of an Auditory Web App

This is my Bachelor's thesis project in collaboration with the inovex GmbH. The goal of this project is to explore the use of sound as a tool to improve user engagement and satisfaction in web-based interfaces. By experimenting with auditory cues for the user interface, we aim to create a more immersive and intuitive experience for users.
